# Sathwik.devtern.The-Discovery-of-handwashing
Dr. Ignaz Semmelweis’s discovery of the importance of handwashing in hospitals revolutionized healthcare and significantly reduced mortality rates. In this project, we will recreate Dr. Semmelweis’s discovery using Python. We will read the historical dataset, explore the relationship between variables over different periods, perform calculations to compare mortality rates before and after handwashing implementation, and visualize the impact of handwashing on reducing mortality rates.

Objective :
Recreate Dr. Ignaz Semmelweis’s discovery of the importance of handwashing in hospitals using Python.

Tasks:

### 1) Data Loading and Exploration
### 2) Exploring relationship between Variables
### 3) Data Visualization of mortality rates
   
Deliverables:

### 1.A description of the data loading and exploration process.
### 2.Analysis of the relationship between variables over different periods.
### 3.Calculations to compare mortality rates before and after handwashing implementation.
### 4.Data visualizations illustrating the impact of handwashing on reducing mortality rates.
